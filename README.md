# Data-structure---Algorithms

This is how I plan to learn DSA using the C programming language. Because it demonstrates how to organize, store, sort, and retrieve data in any structures.
This is an C implementation of Data structure and algorithms.
A data structure is a method of organizing data in a virtual system. 
Think of sequences of numbers, or tables of data: these are both well-defined data structures. 
An algorithm is a sequence of steps executed by a computer that takes an input and transforms it into a target output.
